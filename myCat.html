                A story about a cat lover
            </h2>
            <p id="storyAboutMe">In dozens of kind and amount of memories that 
                 I have been through for more than 18 years, most of them 
                 are quite regular and peace in a boring waythat make me 
                 feel a lot of empty in my soul. Plus, I'm an introvert, 
                 thus, I don't have many friend in my life and all of them 
                 left me because of many thing happen in life, me and 
                 my bestfriend contain a lot of negative feeling have been 
                 suppressed for so long in life and a best friend can not handle all of
                 it in once, a contracy start to happen in characteristic when 
                 someone try to escape cruel life by throw it into a specific 
                 person and the other one find the place to be himself which 
                 is the best friend over their. Hense, now I'm 19 years old, 
                 I don't still don't have any relationship and trying to find a new connection to 
                 walk through in colledge and trying to get rid of an
                 old flame from grade 7 when the true is "I still love her 
                 so much!"
            </p>
                 
            <br /><br />

            <p>Althought I have been 19, but I never have a girlfriend before,
                never taste a kiss before, not even a hug or a feeling of graping 
                a girl's hand. There are many reason for this, althought most of them are my fault,
                but destiny quite sepatate me with love ,therefore, sadnessly, my relationship situation is 
                ... alone... haizz. In process of growing up, I have the sense of love for the first time in 
                grade 5. The first time I start to be attacted by beautiful appearance from girls in my class 
                like the first time a person step into a museum look at a painting on the wall and figure out 
                the reason way they call this a masterpiece. My childhood from primary school 
                are quite memorable day. But the flower is not fully open yet so 
                my love story at this time are quite pure and naive when it just stop at
                laughfing, asking exercise, and free time playing at school yard, so cute.
                    Up to secondary school, fate give me sitting next to a girl that 
                give me an extremely flourishing feeling of love and left me those most memorable 
                memories that can not being forgoten in my life.
